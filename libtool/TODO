In the near future:
********************

* Check whether the version of libtool.m4 is compatible with
ltconfig/ltmain.sh.  Meanwhile, the recommended approach for
developers using automake is to insert libtool.m4 in acinclude.m4.

* Inter-library dependencies should be fully tracked by libtool and
need to work for ltlibraries too. This requires looking up installed
libtool libraries for transparent support.  Support for this feature
is under development, and is expected to be available in libtool 1.4.

* We could have an option to hardcode paths into libraries, as well as
binaries: `... -Wl,-soname -Wl,/tmp/libtest.so.0 ...'.  This is not
possible on all platforms, and is in part obviated by the ability of
linking libtool libraries specified with -lname, but it might still
be desirable.

* Lists of exported symbols should be stored in the pseudo library
so that the size of lt_preloaded_symbols can be reduced.

  libltdl uses such stdio functions as fopen, fgets, feof, fclose, and others.
  These functions are not async-signal-safe. While this does not make 
  libltdl unusable, it restricts its usefulness and puts an 
  unnecessary burden on the user.

  As a remedy, I'd recommend to replace those functions with functions
  that POSIX says are async-signal-safe, such as open, read, close.
  This will require you to handle interrupted system calls and implement
  fgets, but the former isn't hard and there's plenty of implementations
  out from which you can steal the latter.

  I believe relying on async-signal-safe functions to the greatest extent
  possible would greatly improve libltdl's ability to be embedded in and 
  used by other systems.

* Arrange that EXEEXT suffixes are stripped from wrapper script names
only when needed, and that a timestamp file or a wrapper program is
created with the EXEEXT suffix, so that `make' doesn't build it every
time.

* Figure out how to use data items in dlls with win32.
The difficult part is compiling each object which will be linked with an
import lib differently than if it will be linked with a static lib.  This will
almost definitely require that automake pass some hints about linkage in to
each object compilation line.

* Resolve the name clash between import libs and static libs on win32.
Probably the best way to do this is to create lib$name-dll.a for the import
library, and continue to use lib$name.a for the static lib.  libtool
--mode=link can then favour -dll.a over .a if there is a choice.  No point in
doing this until we can export data items (above).

* If not cross-compiling, have the static flag test run the resulting
binary to make sure everything works.

* Implement full multi-language support.  Currently, this is only for
C++, but there are beginnings of this in the manual (Other Languages).
This includes writing libtool not to be so dependent on the compiler
used to configure it.

We especially need this for C++ linking, for which libtool currently
does not handle static constructors properly, even on operating
systems that support them.  ``Don't use static constructors'' is no
longer a satisfactory answer.

* We need some mechanism to allow users to pass flags to the linker
and/or to the compiler, when creating libtool archives.  We could
recognize linker flags such as `-Wl,flag' and `-Xlinker flag' in
libtool's command line, and passing them down to the linker, if "$wl"
is `-Wl,', or stripping the `-Wl,' part if we're calling `ld'
directly.  We could also introduce `-Wc,flag' and `-Xcompiler flag' to
allow unrecognized flags to be passed to the compiler, after stripping
by libtool.  This is already implemented in the CVS tree.

* Another form of convenience library is to have undocumented utility
libraries, where only the shared version is installed.

* We could use libtool object convenience libraries that resolve
symbols to be included in a libtool archive.  This would require some
sort of -whole-archive option, as well.

* Currently, convenience libraries (.al) are built from .lo objects,
except when --disable-shared.  When we can build both shared and
static libraries, we should probably create a .al out of .lo objects
and also a .a out of .o objects.  The .al would only be used to create
shared libraries, whereas the .a would be used for creating static
libraries and programs.  We could also explicitly support `empty'
convenience libraries, that behave as macros that expand to a set of
-Rs, -Ls and -ls switches.

* We should include tests with convenience libraries and reloadable
objects in the testsuite.

* Try to find a work-around for -[all-]static and libltdl on platforms
that will fail to find dlopening functions in this case.  Maybe
creating an alternate libltdl that provides only for dlpreopening, or
creating an additional static library to provide dummy implementations
of the functions that can't be linked statically.  This could hardly
be made completely transparent, though.

* Need to finalize the documentation, and give a specification of
`.la' files so that people can depend on their format.  This would be
a good thing to put before the maintainance notes.

* Filenames containing shell meta-characters are not properly handled
by libtool.  Compiling a file named "a;b.c", for example, fails.

* We could introduce a mechanism to allow for soname rewriting, to
ease multi-libc support.  Installers could specify a prefix, suffix or
sed command to modify the soname, and libtool would create the
corresponding link.  This would allow for rebuilding a library with
the same version number, but depending on different versions of libc,
for example.  In the future, we might even have an option to encode
the sonames of all dependencies of a library into its soname.

Things to think about:
**********************

* Talk with RMS about his so-called `automatic package generation
tool.'  This is probably what Thomas has been murmuring about for the
Hurd.  We'll need to integrate package-supplied programs such as
libtool into that scheme, since it manages some of the preinstall and
postinstall commands, but isn't installed itself.  Probably, things
like libtool should be distributed as part of such a binary package.

* Maybe implement full support for other orthogonal library types
(libhello_g, libhello_p, 64 vs 32-bit ABI's, etc).  Make these types
configurable.
