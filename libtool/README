This is GNU Libtool, a generic library support script.  Libtool hides
the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent, portable
interface.

To use libtool, add the new generic library building commands to your
Makefile, Makefile.in, or Makefile.am.  See the documentation for
details.

Libtool supports building static libraries on all platforms.

Shared library support has been implemented for these platforms:
  AIX 3.x, 4.x (*-*-aix3*, *-*-aix4*)
  BeOS (*-*-beos*)
  BSD/OS 2.1, 3.x, 4.x (*-*-bsdi2.1, *-*-bsdi3*, *-*-bsdi4*)
  Darwin / Mac OS (*-*-darwin*)
  Digital/UNIX 3.x, 4.x, a.k.a. OSF/1 (*-*-osf3*, *-*-osf4*)
  DG/UX R4.11, R4.12, R4.20 (*-*-dguxR411*, *-*-dguxR412*, *-*-dguxR420*)
  FreeBSD 2.x, 3.x, 4.x (*-*-freebsd2*, *-*-freebsd3*, *-*-freebsd4*)
  GNU Hurd (*-*-gnu*)
  GNU/Linux ELF (*-*-linux-gnu*, except aout, coff, and oldld)
  HP-UX 9.x, 10.x, 11.x (*-*-hpux9*, *-*-hpux10*, *-*-hpux11*) [see note]
  IRIX 5.x, 6.x (*-*-irix5*, *-*-irix6*)
  NCR MP-RAS 3.x (*-ncr-sysv4.3*) [see note]
  Motorola System V 4 (mk88-motorola-sysv4) [see note]
  NetBSD 1.x (*-*-netbsd*)
  OpenBSD 2.x (*-*-openbsd*)
  OS/2 using EMX (*-*-os2*)
  SCO OpenServer 5.x (*-*-sco3.2v5*)
  SCO UnixWare 7.x (*-*-sysv5*)
  Solaris 2.x (*-*-solaris2*)
  SunOS 4.x, a.k.a. Solaris 1.x  (*-*-sunos4*)
  UnixWare 2.x (*-*-sysv4.2uw2*)
  UTS 4.x (*-*-uts4*)
  All ELF targets that use both the GNU C compiler (gcc) and GNU ld

NOTE: Some HP-UX sed programs are horribly broken, and cannot handle
libtool's requirements, so users may report unusual problems.  There
is no workaround except to install a working sed (such as GNU sed) on
these systems.

NOTE: The vendor-distributed NCR MP-RAS cc programs emits copyright
on standard error that confuse tests on size of conftest.err.  The
workaround is to specify CC when run configure with CC='cc -Hnocopyr'.

NOTE: Due to a bug in autoconf cc isn't supported on Motorola System V 4.
You can only use gcc. This bug will hopefully be fixed in autoconf 2.14.

NOTE: Any earlier DG/UX system with ELF executables, such as R3.10 or
R4.10, is also likely to work, but hasn't been explicitly tested.

See the file NEWS for a description of recent changes to libtool.

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
libtool.

See the info node (libtool)Tested Platforms. (or the file
doc/PLATFORMS) for a list of platforms that libtool shared library
support was tested on.

If you have any suggestions or bug reports, or you wish to port
libtool to a new platform, please send electronic mail to the libtool
mailing list <libtool@gnu.org> or bug reports to <bug-libtool@gnu.org>.
Don't forget to mention the version of libtool that you are currently
using (by typing `ltconfig --version').
